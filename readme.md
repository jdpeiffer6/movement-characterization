Meeting 3/3/22

- Brenton mentions that we maybe should not me normalizing by velocity...he is in fact correct! We should be normalizing by D^5/A^2, where D is duration of movement and A is movement amplitude. Because V_{mean} = A/D, you can also normalize to D^3/v^2_{mean}...so what I was doing was close to being right...I just needed to think about it a bit more! See Hogan and Sternad 2009 and von Kordelaar 2014.
- Also mentioned that we should quantify the straightness of walking. Even if is straight, we need to quantify if it deviates at an angle.
- I also mentioned we could add a shoulder jerk measure. Time will tell if this is complimentary to thorax or not.
