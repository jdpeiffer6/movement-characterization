# Current tasks
1. figure out discontinuities on joint angle calculation
2. refine interpolation for heel strike detection in gait -- the interpolatewalking function is not returning peaks for most heel strikes??
# Gait:
- test the event detection (RHS,LHS,...) for the distance measurements -> still doesnt work
- refine interpolation for heel strike detection. should be number 1 todo.
- need to include x and y in pelvis/thorax acceleration calculations -> done
- need to apply LPF to to acceleration/jerk calaculations -> done
- add thorax stability measure
# Tandem:
- get miguel out of output!
